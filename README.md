# ULRM Explorer

A lightweight Next.js site that presents the ULRM+ (Universal Linguistic Resonance Machine) research notes as individual pages. The index page explains how to navigate the material, while each sub-page dives into a focused topic—in this case, Structural Coherence.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Available Pages
- `/` – Index page describing the ULRM+ architecture and linking to each deep-dive page.
- `/structural-coherence` – A full-page adaptation of the Structural Coherence modal that contrasts lawful ULRM+ structure with symbolic chaos.
